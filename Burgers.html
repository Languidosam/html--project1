       It's the perfect combination of fresh ingredients, brought together by the closely guarded secret formula that has kept customers coming back for years. <br>
       The Classic Krabby Patty features a juicy, tender patty cooked to perfection and topped with crisp lettuce, a slice of cheddar cheese, crunchy pickles, <br>
       finely chopped onions, a dollop of ketchup, and a smear of mustard, all nestled between a toasted, golden sesame seed bun. <br>

       <li draggable="true" class="whitesmoke">Jelly Patty</li>
       <p class="whitesmoke">The Jelly Patty is a unique twist on the traditional Krabby Patty, featuring a sweet and tangy topping that sets it apart. <br>
       This variant includes the famous jellyfish jelly, a vibrant, glowing purple spread that adds an unexpected flavor explosion with every bite. <br>
       Introduced in the memorable episode "Jellyfish Jam," the Jelly Patty offers a playful contrast between the savory patty and the sweet jelly, making it a hit with those looking for something different. <br>
       The jelly adds a sticky, sugary layer to the burger, enhancing the flavor profile and creating a truly unique eating experience. <br>

       <li draggable="true" class="whitesmoke">Kelp Delight</li>
       <p class="whitesmoke">For the health-conscious residents of Bikini Bottom, the Kelp Delight is the perfect choice. <br>
       This vegetarian version of the Krabby Patty replaces the traditional meat patty with a kelp-based alternative that’s both nutritious and flavorful. <br>
       The Kelp Patty has a distinctive green hue and a slightly earthy taste, reminiscent of the ocean’s natural bounty. <br>
       Accompanied by kelp lettuce, seaweed strips, and a drizzle of tangy seaweed sauce, this burger is packed with vitamins and minerals that make it as healthy as it is tasty. <br>
       The Kelp Delight offers a refreshing take on the Krabby Patty, catering to those who prefer a plant-based diet without sacrificing the deliciousness of a classic burger. <br>
    </p>

       <li draggable="true" class="whitesmoke">Super Spicy Patty</li>
       <p class="whitesmoke">For those who crave a bit of heat, the Super Spicy Patty is the ultimate choice. <br>
       This fiery version of the Krabby Patty is not for the faint of heart. <br>
       The patty is infused with a blend of the hottest sea peppers, giving it a kick that’s sure to make your taste buds tingle. <br>
       Topped with a spicy coral sauce that drips tantalizingly from the sides, this burger also includes the usual lettuce, tomato, and onions, <br>
       but with an added layer of sliced hot sea cucumbers for extra crunch and spice. <br>

    <br>
       <li draggable="true" class="whitesmoke">Bubble Bass</li>
       <p class="whitesmoke">Inspired by the character Bubble Bass, the Bubble Bass Deluxe is a burger that’s as big and bold as its namesake. <br>
       This towering Krabby Patty is double-stacked with two juicy patties, making it twice as satisfying. <br>
       Each layer is packed with all the classic toppings: <br>
       extra pickles (a must-have for Bubble Bass), melted cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, and onions, all held together by a sturdy, sesame-seed bun. <br>
       The Bubble Bass Deluxe is a meal in itself, offering a heartier and more indulgent version of the classic Krabby Patty. <br>
